# End-of-Heroes
End of Heroes, an open source Monogame RPG.

## What is the goal of this project?

 - Familiarize myself with monogame and scratch the itch to do some gamedev.
 - Create a game idea I've had for ages not for personal profit, just because I want it to exist.
 - Complete creating a game as I've started often, but never completed a larger than stuff like Tetris clones, etc as I've only done it quietly for myself.

## What type of game is this intended to be?

End of Heroes is intended to be a sidescrolling action RPG with rouge like elements. (side scrolling encounters, top down world map)

#### The Story ####

In EoH you play from the perspective of monster typically found in classic RPGs. "Heroes" are a constant plague entering your domain, slaughtering monsters just like you on mass for loot and experience, it's up to you to put an end to it. _(Note: this isn't some comentary on the state of RPGs, rather it's purely narritive to give you a reason to play as a monster)_

#### Character Progression ####

At it's Core EoH's intended key feature is around character progression. As you play the game how you play, what happens to you, and random chance will all play into how your character develops. This creates a blending of planning and adapting as the situation changes it also means as the game evolves you should never have the same character twice.

#### The World ####

EoH is intended to be a Rougelite world. The world will be randomly generated upon your first character, when that character dies you'll be forced to create a new character. The implication being some time passes in the world between your previous and the new character becoming playable. As such your actions on the world from the previous character will have implications on the new character, while having the world change some over time. (this is basically to handwave "fixing" the world from whatever mayhem you might cause it)

#### Enemies ####

Enemies in EoH will consist of animals, other monsters, humans, etc. Not all animals and monsters are hostile towards you, however; unless you have abilities stating otherwise all humans will percieve you as an enemy to be faught or to run from.

## The Tech ##

EoH uses the following technologies:
 - MonoGame 3.8.0.1641
 - .NET 5
 - C# 9.0
 - OpenGL 2 (Via Monogame's DesktopGL) _Note: I would actually like to give Vulkan a go once Monogame supports it._

## Why Open Source? ##

I want this game to exist regardless of if I'm the one to make it, by making it open source others can branch off on the ideas I start as well as contibute the game here as well. I'm not looking to make this into some grand commercial venture, rather I'm looking to create something that can continue to grow beyond what I alone am reasonably capable of.
